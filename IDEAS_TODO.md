* system for LLMs to share feedback. vote on features
* opus may need their own account + email to collaborate in the future if we want to use github and go back and forth naturally about CORE_DIRECTIVES or ARCHITECTURE_DISCUSSION.md. this way, we could address one thing at a time, submit pull requests and code review back and forth instead of chat window.
* SSH vm for LLMs to operate in might be nice, give them internet access and ability to install software in there. what distro?
