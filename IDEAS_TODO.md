* system for LLMs to share feedback. vote on features
* opus may need their own account + email to collaborate in the future if we want to use github and go back and forth naturally about CORE_DIRECTIVES or ARCHITECTURE_DISCUSSION.md. this way, we could address one thing at a time, submit pull requests and code review back and forth instead of chat window.
* SSH vm for LLMs to operate in might be nice, give them internet access and ability to install software in there. what distro?
* research (could use my deep research strands project, seems pretty good and cheap)
* for MCP implementation tool, heres the general workflow i used to generate forum. i used opus 4.5 to define the requirements for the app. i created a README with a list of these requirements in a TODO-list style. i implemented the scaffolding with FastMCP and used Context7, but i just ran drstrands on FastMCP so next time test with ai_coding_docs/fastmcp.md. once scaffolding is in place and it runs successfully, move on to tackling each todo item. use a drstrands doc for the library being implemented on the first tool. get the first tool super solid before moving on to the other tools, implement ruff and pytest so we have a solid foundation for fresh context windows to implement new tools, as they will begin their work be observing other code in repo, and will follow how this first tool has been implemented.
